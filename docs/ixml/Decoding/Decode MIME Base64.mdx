# Decode MIME Base64

### Anatomy

```xml
<decode:base64 var="var">
    string
</decode:base64>
```

 **Description**:
 DECODE:BASE64 decodes a value according to RFC 2045 by converting printable characters back to arbitrary byte sequences.

MIME Base64 is designed to make binary data survive transport through transport layers that are not 8-bit clean. MIME Base64-encoded data is about 33 percent larger than the unencoded data.

DECODE:BASE64 is the complement of the ENCODE:BASE64 operation.
