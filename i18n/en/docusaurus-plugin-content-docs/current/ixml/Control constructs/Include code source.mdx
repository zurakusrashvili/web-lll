# Include code source

### Anatomy

```xml
<include var="var" var_params="var" once="bool">
    ixml
</include>
```

 **Description**:
 INCLUDE parses and executes an external code source, specified by a filename/URL. Arguments may be passed to local variables as parameters on switch of context.


> **Attention:**
>
> The code source incorporates a local context when being included. Therefore local variables may be declared within the code source.
> 
> The special local variable 'return' is a reference to the return value that is passed back as the result of INCLUDE.
> 
> The special local variable 'arguments' is a reference to all arguments that have been passed to local variables on switch of context.
> 
> The RETURN, BREAK and NEXT operations may be used to break-off the execution of the current code source, thereby implicitly returning to the original control flow of the invoking control statement.
