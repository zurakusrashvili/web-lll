# Encode MIME Base64

### Anatomy

```xml
<encode:base64 var="var">
    string
</encode:base64>
```

 **Description**:
 ENCODE:BASE64 encodes a value according to RFC 2045 using a 65-character printable subset of US-ASCII to represent arbitrary byte sequences.

MIME Base64 is designed to make binary data survive transport through transport layers that are not 8-bit clean. MIME Base64-encoded data is about 33 percent larger than the unencoded data.

ENCODE:BASE64 is the complement of the DECODE:BASE64 operation.

### Content: string

```xml
<content type="string"/>
```
